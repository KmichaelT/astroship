# Project Description
This project aims to develop an automated traffic control system that instantly notifies drivers when they violate traffic rules and provides a real-time penalty notification and payment system. The system will utilize cameras, sensors, and AI to detect violations (e.g., turning on red where not allowed) and send a real-time SMS notification to the driver, including:
* Location of violation
* Penalty amount
* Payment options (manual or auto-pay setup)

In addition to enforcing traffic laws, the system will include a mobile app that:
* Notify and process violation penalties automatically
* Educates drivers on safe driving practices with reminders and pop-up quizzes
* Ranks drivers based on driving behavior using real-time data from multiple users
* Provides graphical insights on a driver's safety ranking compared to others

We will create a fully functional prototype including:
* A 0.1-mile road setup with cameras and sensors
* 5 vehicles for testing
* A mobile app with real-time notifications and payment processing
* At least 5 users interacting with the system

This project enhances road safety by educating drivers while ensuring efficient and automated traffic law enforcement.

Project Details: Full details of the project will be provided upon acceptance.

# Goal
To develop and test a fully functional prototype led entirely by student innovators who will gain hands-on experience in technology, design, and real-world problem-solving.
