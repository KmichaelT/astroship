# Project Description
This project aims to develop a smart waste management system that uses IoT sensors and real-time monitoring to optimize waste collection and promote recycling. The system includes:
* Smart bins with fill-level monitoring
* Automatic waste sorting capabilities
* Route optimization for collection vehicles
* Real-time tracking and analytics

The system will feature a mobile app that:
* Shows real-time bin fill levels
* Provides optimal collection routes
* Tracks recycling metrics
* Offers educational content about waste management

We will create a prototype including:
* 10 smart bins with sensors
* Mobile app for waste collectors and citizens
* Central monitoring dashboard
* Analytics platform for data visualization

This project promotes environmental sustainability through efficient waste management and increased recycling awareness.

Project Details: Full details of the project will be provided upon acceptance.

# Goal
To create an innovative waste management solution that optimizes collection efficiency while promoting environmental consciousness among students and communities.
