# Project Description
This project aims to develop an augmented reality campus navigation system that helps users easily find their way around campus facilities. The system will feature:
* AR-based directional guidance
* Real-time facility information
* Accessibility route options
* Event-based navigation

The application will include:
* Indoor and outdoor navigation
* Point-of-interest information
* Real-time occupancy data
* Event and schedule integration

We will create a prototype covering:
* Main campus building complex
* AR-enabled mobile app
* Backend management system
* IoT sensor network

This project improves campus accessibility while providing an innovative solution to navigation challenges.

Project Details: Full details of the project will be provided upon acceptance.

# Goal
To develop an intuitive AR navigation system that enhances campus accessibility and improves the overall experience for students, staff, and visitors.
